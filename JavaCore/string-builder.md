# Java StringBuilder: A Practical Guide

---

## What is `StringBuilder`?

- `StringBuilder` is a **mutable sequence of characters**.
- Unlike `String`, which is **immutable** (unchangeable after creation), `StringBuilder` allows **modifying the string content without creating new objects each time**.
- Ideal for scenarios with **frequent string modifications** such as append, insert, or delete.

## Why Use `StringBuilder`?

Consider this example using `String` concatenation:

```java
String s = "";
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    s += i;
}
```

- Each concatenation creates a **new String object**.
- This leads to significant **memory and performance overhead**.

With `StringBuilder`, the same task becomes:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    sb.append(i);
}
String s = sb.toString();
```

- `StringBuilder` **modifies the same object** without creating intermediate strings.
- Much more **efficient** in time and memory.

## How Does `StringBuilder` Work Internally?

1. **Backed by a char array:**  
   Holds a **resizable array of characters** internally.

2. **Capacity and resizing:**  
   Starts with an initial capacity (default 16).  
   When full, it **doubles the array size**, copies the old content, and continues.

3. **Appending:**  
   Adds characters at the current position and updates the count.

4. **Converting to String:**  
   Calling `.toString()` creates a new immutable `String` with the current contents.

## Key Methods

| Method          | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `append(...)`   | Add characters, strings, numbers, etc.   |
| `insert(...)`   | Insert characters at a specific index    |
| `delete(...)`   | Remove characters from a range            |
| `replace(...)`  | Replace characters in a specified range  |
| `toString()`    | Convert the builder content to a `String`|

## Comparison: String vs StringBuilder

| Feature               | `String`                   | `StringBuilder`           |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Mutability            | Immutable                  | Mutable                   |
| Performance on concat | Slow (new objects created) | Fast (in-place modification) |
| Thread Safety         | Thread-safe                | Not thread-safe           |
| Use case             | Fixed strings              | Dynamic string building   |

---

## Summary

- Use `StringBuilder` when you need to **build or modify strings frequently**.
- It improves **performance** by avoiding unnecessary object creation.
- Remember: it is **not thread-safe**. Use `StringBuffer` if you need thread safety.
