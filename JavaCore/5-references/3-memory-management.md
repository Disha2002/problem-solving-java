# Memory Management in Java

## Overview

Java manages memory automatically through the JVM, primarily using Garbage Collection (GC) to reclaim unused objects. Understanding JVM memory structure and GC behavior is key to writing efficient, memory-safe applications.

## JVM Memory Areas

| Memory Area       | Description                                     | Shared/Thread-Private |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Heap**          | Stores all Java objects and arrays               | Shared               |
| **Method Area**   | Stores class metadata, static variables, constants | Shared               |
| **Java Stack**    | Stores frames for method invocations, local vars  | Thread-private       |
| **PC Register**   | Stores address of current instruction             | Thread-private       |
| **Native Method Stack** | Stores native method calls                    | Thread-private       |

## Heap Structure

- **Young Generation:**
  - **Eden Space:** New objects created here.
  - **Survivor Spaces (S0, S1):** Objects surviving minor GC move here.

- **Old Generation (Tenured):**
  - Objects surviving multiple minor GCs are promoted here.

- **Metaspace (replaced PermGen):**
  - Stores class metadata and loaded classes.
  - Grows dynamically based on need.

## Garbage Collection (GC)

### Types of GC:

- **Minor GC:**
  - Cleans Young Generation.
  - Frequent and fast.
  - Objects that survive are moved to Survivor spaces or promoted.

- **Major GC (Full GC):**
  - Cleans Old Generation and sometimes entire heap.
  - Slower and more expensive.

### Common GC Algorithms:

- **Serial GC:**  
  Single-threaded, suitable for small heaps.

- **Parallel GC:**  
  Multi-threaded, optimized for throughput.

- **CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep):**  
  Low pause collector for Old Generation, concurrent phases.

- **G1 (Garbage First) GC:**  
  Divides heap into regions; balances pause times and throughput.

## Best Practices for Memory Management

- **Avoid Memory Leaks:**
  - Nullify references when no longer needed.
  - Be cautious with static collections.
  - Use weak references for caches.

- **Minimize Object Creation:**
  - Reuse objects when possible.
  - Use primitives instead of wrapper classes.

- **Use Appropriate Data Structures:**
  - Choose based on memory and access patterns.

- **Tune JVM Heap Settings:**
  - Set initial and max heap sizes (`-Xms`, `-Xmx`).
  - Configure GC options based on application needs.

---

## Monitoring and Profiling

- Use tools like:
  - **VisualVM**
  - **JConsole**
  - **Java Mission Control (JMC)**
  - **Heap dumps and GC logs**

- Analyze memory usage, GC pauses, and object allocation.

## Summary

Java's automatic memory management simplifies development but requires awareness of JVM internals and GC behavior for optimal performance. Proper coding practices and tuning JVM settings help prevent memory issues and enhance application stability.
