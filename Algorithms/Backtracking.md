# 🧠 Backtracking: A Practical Guide for Techies

---

## What is Backtracking?

Backtracking is a recursive algorithmic technique used for solving problems incrementally by **building candidates** and **abandoning** a candidate (“backtrack”) as soon as you determine it cannot lead to a valid solution.

Think of it as:

> Controlled brute-force + early rejection of invalid paths.

---

## When to Use Backtracking

Use it when:

- You need to **generate all valid configurations** (permutations, combinations, subsets).
- There are **constraints** that must be satisfied.
- You are solving problems like:
  - Sudoku
  - N-Queens
  - Word Search
  - Maze solving
  - Parentheses generation
  - Combination Sum
  - Expression builder with operators

## 🔁 Backtracking Pattern (Template)

```python
def backtrack(state, choices):
    if is_solution(state):
        save(state)
        return

    for choice in choices:
        if is_valid(choice, state):
            apply(choice, state)
            backtrack(state, choices)
            undo(choice, state)  # Backtrack
```

- `state` → current progress toward a solution
- `choices` → available decisions to try
- `is_valid()` → constraint check
- `undo()` → key part of "backtracking"

---

## 🏗️ Conceptual Model

### You are:
- **Building** a solution step-by-step.
- **Checking** if each step breaks the rules.
- **Going deeper** when it's valid.
- **Backing up** when it fails.

---

## 🧩 Example: Sudoku Solver (High-Level)

- For each empty cell:
  - Try 1 through 9.
  - If it's valid, place it and recurse.
  - If it leads to a dead end, backtrack and try next number.

### Key Idea:
> Try, check, recurse, undo.

## 🧠 Difference From DFS?

Backtracking **is** DFS, but more:
- It **builds and rejects paths** based on constraints.
- It's **goal-driven**: only valid full solutions are kept.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Think of your problem as a **tree of decisions**.
- Use pruning to avoid wasting time on bad paths.
- If you find yourself saying: “Let me try this, and undo if it doesn't work”—that’s backtracking.

## 🔍 Classic Problems to Practice

| Problem               | Type              |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| N-Queens              | Constraints Grid  |
| Generate Parentheses  | Combinatorics     |
| Sudoku Solver         | Constraint Solver |
| Word Search           | Grid + DFS        |
| Subsets / Permutations| Combinations      |
| Expression Add Operators | Expression Tree|

## 🧪 Summary

Backtracking is:
- Recursive trial-and-error
- Constraint-based pruning
- Ideal for generating or solving under rules

Master the mindset:
> “Build partial solutions. If a decision leads to a dead end, back up and try something else.”
