# Java Problem Solving & Learning Journey 🚀

This repository tracks my journey of mastering **Java**, **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, and **systematic problem solving**.  
It includes practice from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, GFG, and hands-on Java programs for real-world understanding.

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

To become a **highly skilled problem solver** and **Java backend engineer**, I'm building:
- Strong fundamentals in Java (OOPs, Collections, Streams)
- Pattern-based problem-solving ability (DSA)
- Code fluency and debugging skills
- Real-world project readiness
