# Keeping History Clean

A clean Git history makes it easier to understand the evolution of a project, track down bugs, and collaborate with others. This guide covers techniques to keep your history clear and manageable.

## Why Keep History Clean?

- Easier to review changes
- Simplifies debugging and bisecting
- Clear documentation of project evolution
- Better collaboration and less confusion

## Techniques for Clean History

### 1. Write Atomic Commits

- Each commit should represent a single logical change.
- Avoid mixing unrelated fixes or features in one commit.

### 2. Use Branches

- Develop features or fixes in separate branches.
- Keep the main branch stable and clean.

### 3. Rebase Before Merging

- Use `git rebase` to clean up commit history on feature branches.
- Squash small or fixup commits to reduce noise.
- Rebase keeps history linear and easier to follow.

### 4. Squash Commits

- Combine related commits before merging to the main branch.
- Use interactive rebase (`git rebase -i`) to squash commits.

### 5. Avoid Merge Commits When Possible

- Prefer rebasing and fast-forward merges for simpler history.
- Merge commits can clutter history if overused.

### 6. Write Good Commit Messages

- Clear, descriptive messages make history meaningful.

## Example Workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feature/update-ui

# make several small commits

git rebase -i main   # squash/fixup commits interactively
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only feature/update-ui
git push origin main
```

## Summary

Keeping your Git history clean requires discipline but pays off with easier maintenance, better collaboration, and a more professional codebase.
