# What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system** designed to help developers track changes in their source code during software development.

## Why Use Git?

- **Track changes:** Record history of changes made to files.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously.
- **Branching:** Create separate branches to work on features or bug fixes without affecting the main code.
- **Backup:** Keep a backup of your project history.
- **Revert:** Undo mistakes by reverting to previous versions.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Repository (Repo):** A folder containing your project files and the Git version history.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of your changes.
- **Branch:** A parallel version of your project to work on new features or fixes.
- **Merge:** Combine branches back together.

## History in Brief

- Created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 to manage Linux kernel development.
- Fast, reliable, and scalable.
- Became the de facto standard for version control in modern software development.

## How Git Works

- Git stores data as a series of snapshots.
- Each commit points to the previous commit, forming a chain.
- Changes are saved locally, allowing offline work.
- Push and pull synchronize changes with remote repositories like GitHub.

## Summary

Git is a powerful tool for managing code changes efficiently, enabling teamwork and version control in software projects of any size.
