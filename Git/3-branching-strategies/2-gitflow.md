# Gitflow Workflow

**Gitflow** is a popular branching model that defines a strict branching strategy designed for managing large projects with regular releases.

## üß± Key Branches

| Branch        | Purpose                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `main`        | Contains production-ready code       |
| `develop`     | Integration branch for features      |
| `feature/*`   | Individual features under development|
| `release/*`   | Pre-release preparation              |
| `hotfix/*`    | Emergency fixes for production bugs  |

---

## üîÅ Gitflow Workflow Steps

### 1. Start a New Feature

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
```

Do your work, then:

```bash
git commit -m "Add awesome feature"
git checkout develop
git merge feature/awesome-feature
git branch -d feature/awesome-feature
```

---

### 2. Start a Release

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/1.2.0
```

- Final testing, docs, version bumps, etc.
- Then:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge release/1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release 1.2.0"
git checkout develop
git merge release/1.2.0
git branch -d release/1.2.0
```

---

### 3. Start a Hotfix

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix
```

Fix the issue, then:

```bash
git commit -m "Fix: urgent production bug"
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/urgent-fix
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix 1.2.1"
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/urgent-fix
git branch -d hotfix/urgent-fix
```

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Structured and consistent process
- Clear role for each branch
- Great for managing multiple versions and releases

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons

- Overhead for smaller teams
