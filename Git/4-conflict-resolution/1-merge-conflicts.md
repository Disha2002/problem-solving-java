# Merge Conflicts

A **merge conflict** occurs when Git is unable to automatically reconcile differences between two commits.

---

## üß† When Do Merge Conflicts Happen?

Conflicts typically occur when:

- Two branches modify the same line in a file.
- A file is deleted in one branch but modified in another.
- Changes are made to a file and it is renamed elsewhere.

---

## üî• Example Scenario

You and a teammate both edit `app.js`:

- You edit line 10 in `feature/navbar`.
- Your teammate edits line 10 in `main`.
- You try to merge `main` into your branch ‚Üí conflict!

## üß™ How to Identify Conflicts

Git will notify you:

```bash
Auto-merging app.js
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in app.js
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Resolve Conflicts

1. Open the conflicted file(s):

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> main
```

2. Edit the file manually to keep what you want.
3. After resolving:

```bash
git add app.js
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in app.js"
```

---

## üßπ Abort the Merge

If you want to cancel:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Pull frequently to avoid diverging too far from `main`.
- Communicate with your team on overlapping files.
- Keep commits focused and small.
- Use code review tools to catch issues early.
